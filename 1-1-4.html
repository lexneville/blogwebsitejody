        Unit 1 - 1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects
    </h2>
    <p class="mainPara">There are many risks associated with carrying out a project through to completion. These risks
        include the
        possibility of key team members departing the company mid-project, loss of data through cyber-attack or theft or
        inaccurate costings causing a lack of funds to complete the project [5]. We can categorise these risks into 4
        types,

        known/knowns - We are aware of these risks during the planning stage and we have a plan to implement should they
        occur.

        known/unknowns - These risks are foreseen but we are not fully prepared to resolve them.

        unknown/knowns - We are not aware of these risks at the planning stage but we have to ability to resolve them if
        they occur.

        unknown/unknowns - We are not aware of these risks and do not know how to respond to them. [4]
