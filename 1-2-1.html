    <p class="mainPara">
        During the creation of my website, I have taken stock of the tools I am using and have not felt the need to
        change them. I have worked on this project using three different computers, a 2017 MacBook Pro here at
        @wearecodenation, a Windows 10 desktop and a 2009 MacBook, at home. Using Trello, Google Docs and VS Code across
        these different specification machines has not caused me any issues. I am happy to remain using VS Code as my
        development environment, the suggestion tool it possesses has allowed me to speed up the inputting of code, and
        allowed me to spend more time on creating the content and styling of my website. Both Trello and Google Docs are
        web based tools and therefore have allowed me to seamless transition between workstations, without any worries
        with regard to moving data around.
