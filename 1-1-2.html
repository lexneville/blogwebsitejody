        Unit 1 - 1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully
    </h2>
    <p class="mainPara">In order to successfully complete a digital project we need to assemble a team of people with
        specialist skills
        that include, but are not limited to, software programming, problem solving, graphic design and copywriting. We
        need to utilise time management, collaborative working, and strict version control to ensure an efficient
        working process. Suitable hardware such as workstations, storage and networking are obviously of paramount
        importance as is a workspace that is fit for purpose.
