    <p class="mainPara">
        To improve my working methods I would plan the project on paper more thoroughly before I started to code or
        prepare content. I found it easy to become overwhelmed with new ideas and struggled at times to remain focussed
        on one task at a time. Increasing my use of a kanban board and giving myself tighter deadlines would help me
        stay on track.
        In terms of efficiency and productivity of a team, it would be beneficial to split the project into different
        sub-teams, such as a front-end coding team to work on the visual look of the site or application and a team of
        back-end coders to work on the functionality of the product. A separate team to prepare the content to be
        featured in the product would allow for coders to be focussed on the side of the project they are most suited
        for. In essence we must place people where they will be able to work to their strengths and abilities, this is
        the key to working effectively as a team.
