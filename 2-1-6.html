    <p class="mainPara">
        When designing any digital project we must take into account the fact that there will be different accessibility
        requirements depending on the end user.
        A person with sight impairment may need to be able to access a braille encoded, high contrast or audio described
        version of the product.
        Any audio related content would need to be provided in text form if the user is hard of hearing or deaf.
        People whose first language is not English will need to have the page translated for them to use it comfortably.
        There are tools that are provided free of charge by companies such as Google that can help resolve these issues
        using the cloud, without the need for specific code to be written.
