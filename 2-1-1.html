    <p class="mainPara">
        The majority of pages on my website have a centred paragraph of text, answering a specific question that was
        asked as part of the qualification coursework. Other than the home page, all pages have a non-scrolling
        navigation bar fixed at the top of the window, with clickable links that move you around the website. I used
        sourced photos as page backgrounds and processed these to allow the paragraph text to stand out. The image I
        used on the home page was one I had created in the past and is also used on my personal social media . I chose a
        typeface that I sourced from Google Fonts and applied a drop shadow to further improve the readability of text
        within the site. Large, bold headings were used at the top, centre of each page and for any pages that would
        require scrolling to read all of the content, I added a ‘back to top’ link at the foot of the page.
