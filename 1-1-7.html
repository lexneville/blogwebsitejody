        1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital
        projects

    </h2>
    <p>With regard to the legal guidelines we must adhere to when creating a digital product, GDPR or the General Data
        Protection Regulation, must be taken into account when handling data provided by the public. GDPR has replaced
        the 1995 Data Protection Directive and is intended to create consistent data protection rules across Europe [7].
        Companies must be upfront and transparent as to what a member of the publicâ€™s data will be used for, and who it
        may be shared with. GDPR intends to make it easier for the public to gain access to any of their data that is
        held by a company. Secure storage of any public data is therefore paramount.
