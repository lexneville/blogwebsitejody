    <p class="mainPara">
        There are file formats that we will come across regularly when creating websites. The languages we can use to
        construct a site are HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language, which is stored in an .html file. We use CSS or Cascade
        Style Sheets to create the look of our site, such as fonts, spacing and background images, these take the form
        of a .css file. Images can be in the form of a .jpg, .png, .svc, or gif, amongst others. Video files will
        usually be a .mpg, .avi or .mov file. Audio can be in the form of a .wav, .mp3 or .mid.
        The ability to download files from the internet will mean that practically any format may be seen within a
        website but may not be utilised in the actual form or function of the site.
