        In reviewing the outcome of the task, I can refer back to the project requirements that were defined within the
        brief. During executing the task I was required to prepare the content to be displayed on the site. I therefore
        researched the individual questions and topics to be covered, and prepared a Google Docs file to collect all of
        my written content into one place.
        This could then be accessed and worked on anywhere with a network connection.
        In order to ensure my file structure was easy to keep on top of, I stored all of the images to be used on the
        website in their own folder. I also edited these images to increase the brightness to make sure that text was
        easily readable when layered above these images.
        To confirm that my website navigation links were working and that the site was easy to move around, I asked a
        colleague to give it a test run and asked for any feedback they had.
