    <p class="mainPara">I believe the tools I selected were highly appropriate to be used to complete this task. VS Code
        was a great application for constructing a website as it bends over backwards to help you to avoid making
        mistakes, through itâ€™s version control features.
        Trello was perfectly adequate for use when keeping track of both the small jobs and overall progress of the
        project. It has a simple drag and drop interface that keeps the process of adding or updating tasks very
        streamlined. If I wanted to organise my time more strictly, Trello offered the ability to add a deadline to
        tasks as well as organising them by category.
