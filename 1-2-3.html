        Overall, I am happy with the look, functionality and content of my website. I
        tried to keep the style simple and kept the need to scroll the pages of my site to a minimum. I wanted to give
        the coursework answers a page of their own, to give the feel of a slide based presentation to my website. This
        has resulted in the construction of a large amount of individual pages compared to collating all the coursework
        answers into one scrollable page. With more available time this would not have been an issue, but as the
        deadline approached, I had a lot of copy and pasting to do to complete the job.
        I think my site is easy to move around due to the use of a navigation bar and links within each page allowing
        you to quickly get to where you want to be. The site map page allows viewing of a list of links that can take
        the user to a specific answer within the coursework pages.
