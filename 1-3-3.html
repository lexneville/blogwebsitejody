    <p class="mainPara">
        In order to improve my productivity on future projects I would look at saving as much code as possible for reuse
        or to refer back to, rather than have to research a solution using a search engine. For projects where teamwork
        would be an option, I would certainly split the job into smaller tasks and keep communication lines open using
        Slack. Slack could be used to share files and code between the team and allow for text channels to be setup for
        smaller groups working on specific tasks together. Group voice chat functionality could be provided by setting
        up a Discord server and holding remote stand-ups on a regular basis, should meeting in person not be an option.
