        During the writing of the code for my website, the fact that VS Code has an inbuilt code checker has allowed me
        to make changes if a mistake has been flagged. During the process of constructing the site I would consistently
        check my work for functionality and over aesthetic consistency. Now that I have completed the website, I have
        made sure to double check my work and recruited fellow students to give the site a test run and feedback any
        bugs or broken links they may have found. In future projects, members of the public could be asked to test run
        the product as long as non-disclosure agreements had been signed in order to protect any sensitive information
        that could potentially be passed on to competitors.
