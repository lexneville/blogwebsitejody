        In order to select the correct tools to carry out a digital task or project, we must first collate a list of the
        features that our tools, both software and hardware, should have. Cost will be a consideration that we must
        focus on, depending on how much revenue the project will save or generate, we may have to be frugal with the
        procurement of these tools. It is of paramount importance that the team is involved in this process as they will
        be using the tools day-to-day and must be comfortable working with them. The choice of platform deployment will
        obviously have a major impact on which systems are used to complete the task. [6]
