        When creating digital content it is of great importance to keep check of where any assets have been sourced
        from, in order to steer clear of any copyright claims. These assets could take the form of images, audio or
        text, amongst others. Where permission is required before use of an asset we must make sure that this permission
        has been granted before anything is published or sold. We must provide a visible credit to a creator/owner,
        where it has been requested before use.
        It is most cost effective to search out royalty free content, alternatively producing these assets in house, as
        opposed to paying for the privilege, may prove to be more frugal and these saved funds could be utilised
        elsewhere.
