        terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <p class="mainPara">
        The benefits of using IT systems when carrying out this project were vast. The easy access to shared cloud
        storage such as Google Drive allowed me to stay on top of the location of assets and reduce the need for
        physical storage.
        When working as a team communication is more streamlined when the right tools are selected. These allow for team
        members to be located at different workplaces but remain effectively in touch with each other.
        The drawbacks can include potential leaking of assets or code, data loss through either hardware breakdown or
        lack of a suitable back-up system, and also staff could become overwhelmed if too many tools are used.
