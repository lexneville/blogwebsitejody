        If I was given more time to work on my website before submitting, I would look into writing some javascript to
        offer people with poor eyesight a more readable version of the site. I would have liked to have spent more time
        sourcing a different background image for each screen, instead of using the same few, multiple times. I would
        like to have a page to show off some of the Javascript skills learnt earlier in the course. I would also like to
        add a looping ambient music file to give the ears of the user a treat whilst they browse.
        I have come to the realisation that there will always be improvements that can be made to a website, and it is
        important not to take on more than you can handle with regard to any deadline that must be met.
