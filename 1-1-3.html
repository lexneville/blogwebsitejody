    <p>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT

        In order to work efficiently and effectively, we need to plan out our project beforehand. We must identify the
        various tasks that must be carried out, we can then utilise tools such as a kanban board to split the job into
        small chunks and then distribute these tasks between the team. During the construction of this website I created
        a kanban board using the website Trello.com and this was therefore accessible from any computer with internet
        access. I tracked my progress using the To Do, Doing, Done system. The kanban board for this website project can
        be viewed at the following address. Https://trello.com/b/mZMjFPST/blog-website-jody-richardson

        In order to check that our plan is comprehensive, we can use a mnemonic to help [3]:
