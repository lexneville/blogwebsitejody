        Using Github has allowed me to work on my project outside of the Code Nation office, without any worries with
        regard to version control. After ensuring that the dayâ€™s code has been saved to my Github repository, I can pull
        the updated files into my workstations at home to put some extra time into researching and trying out new code
        and styles.
        Using the website Trello, to facilitate the use of the kanban method of organisation, has proved invaluable in
        allowing me to note down and keep track of the various tasks related to completing this project. As an idea or
        problem popped up, I was able to quickly switch over to Trello and add a card to a particular list of tasks to
        ensure that things were not forgotten.
        I used the open source image editing software, GIMP, to process the background images used on my site. It is a
        full featured program and as I have been using it for a few years, it saved me time compared to using an
        unfamiliar program.
        I believe I have chosen perfectly adequate tools that are well suited to completing the tasks I required of
        them.
