  <p class="mainPara">
    Hi, my name is Jody and as I type this I am sat at a desk @wearecodenation
    in Manchester, at the start of my journey into a career in coding!
    <br>
    My first experience with code was at the young age of 4 years old. My
    uncle and I, at my Grandmotherâ€™s house, sat huddled around his Sinclair
    Spectrum 48k typing out lines of BASIC from a magazine. After what seemed
    like hours, we had the amazing game, Blitz, to play!
    <br>
    From that moment I was hooked on Video Games and the technology that
    powered them.
